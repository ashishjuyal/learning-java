OOP: Concept of Class and Object

Attributes and behaviour

Middle class: earning well, lives at a decent place, owns a car

X class: board exams, senior class, all subjects

XI class: specific subjects

Class is a blue print. 

Student: blueprint
Attributes:
	- studies in a school
	- roll no
	- class
	- subjects
	- marks
Behaviour: 
	- studies
	- appear in exams
	- can also tell about the grades

Objects:
Ashish is a student
Anusha is a student


Employee:
Attributes:
	- company name
	- employee id
	- salary
	- dept
Behaviour:
	- some responsibilities
	- we can ask his salary
	- we can ask for his department

Objects:
Rajesh is a employee
Vishal is a employee

We use blueprint to create objects
All the objects of a blueprint will be same but can have different attribute values, such as name, id, salary, grades


Button:
	attribute/property:
		- icon
		- text
		- size
	behaviour:
		- does something when clicked


We define attribute/properties by variables and behaviour by Method (does something, that means verb).

Function and Methods


C and C++ generates machine code.

one thing is hardware and other is OS

iPhone / iOS 	 -> arm based CPU
laptop / windows -> intel based CPU x86

Java does not create machine code it creates something called byte code.

byte code executes in java virtual machine

Source -> compile -> byte code -> JVM (java virtual machine)
